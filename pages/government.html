            <p>Bhutan is a small country located in the Himalayan mountains. The government of Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy, meaning the country has a king as the head of state, but political power is shared with an elected government.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Prime Minister:</strong> The Prime Minister is the head of the government, elected by the people through parliamentary elections. The Prime Minister leads the government and is responsible for the administration of the country.

                <li>
                    <strong>Parliament:</strong> Bhutan's parliament is a bicameral system, consisting of two houses:
